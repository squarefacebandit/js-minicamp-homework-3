# Homework #3

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Objects =  a variable that stores other variables. Every data type other than a number, string, or boolean is an Object, including Arrays.
	* Properties =  the name given to each of an Object's sub-variables through which to be accessed with.
	* Methods = blocks of code that do work from within an Object, and can return data back to where they were first called.
	* for in loop = an easier way to iterate over all the properties of an Object.
	* Dot notation vs bracket notation = bracket notation allows access of an Object's properties with string variables.  Use dot notation as a default until you come upon a situation where brackets are required.
	


2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.
		
	* `git status`
	* `git add --all`
	* `git status`
	* `git commit -m "your commit message"`
	* `git push origin master`

3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.  Run tests using `npm test`.

4. Make the tests pass!
